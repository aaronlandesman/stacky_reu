General Lemmata
	General: Graded ring initial ideal quadratic minimal
	Inductive: adding 1-sat pts
	Definition: Admissible
	Inductive: Raising degree

(Save compicated genus zero case for last)
Genus positive  —-Check admissibility under adding at a point (of 3 to all 3s)
	Genus 1
		Inductive: adding 2-sat pts
		Base cases —— —- (base case with 1 stacky point and no log points) & 1 log point and 0 canonical divisor
		Application of induction

	Genus >1
		Demonstration of saturation
		Half-canonical sheaf generators and relations
		Application of induction

Genus zero
	Effective
		Demonstration of saturation
		Application of induction (1-sat)

	Ineffective
		Demonstration of saturation
		Inductive: adding 3-sat pts
		Base cases
		Exceptional cases
		Application of induction
