For a Q-divisor (Weil divisor) D on a rational surface X one can consider the
graded ring  R(X,D) with graded piece the space of sections of O([dD]) on X.
The paper in question gives sharp bounds on the generators and relations 
of such rings. The paper follows a paper of o'Dorney where the case of X=P^1
is considered. The authors express the hope that this may help to describe
generators and relations for rings of modular forms on certain moduli spaces.
That might be the case, but is not adstructed by examples. The paper has
a rather combinatorial nature. It seems correct. It could be a useful paper
and deserves publication.

The presentation can be improved quite a lot. 
For example, why give in Section 1.1 the main results in a form
that the reader can only understand if he/she first reads later sections. 
In Thm 1.1, say that c_i/k_i is reduced. In Thm 1.2 what is k ? Any conditions
on this field? Page 2, line -9, deg(D)= ?
But Thm. 1.4 is unreadable at this stage.

Section 2 starts with definitions that should have come earlier. (Was Section
1.1 added in a later stage ?) Page 5, line 7, reference to things that come later.
In Thm 2.5 the best lower approximations are not explained. These come later
(page 9 and 10). 

As to the terminology, one may ask whether the name 'canonical ring' (on page 1)
is a well-chosen name. 

Conclusion: the paper should be rewritten completely.
The bibliography should be updated and misprints corrected.
